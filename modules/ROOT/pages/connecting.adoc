== Introduction

{description}

== Physical Location of User Files

Compared to earlier versions of this app (< 2.19), the location for files created or managed by this app is called *Scoped Storage*. Scoped Storage is, in contrast to Shared Storage, protected and part of the app. It is saved in the device's storage (persistent memory) and limited by its capacity. Files are now safe and private and can only be accessed by other apps that use the {document-provider-url}[Documents Provider]. Internal tests have successfully passed using more than 50GB of Scoped Storage without any issues.

""
Document provider â€” A content provider that allows a storage service to reveal the files it manages
""

When a connection is removed or the app is uninstalled, all files are removed for that connection or the whole app by design - securing data privacy.

NOTE: Consider if there is  there's enough _internal storage capacity_ for your files to be synced by the app. As a rule of thumb, check the capacity necessary via the ownCloud web access first before enabling a sync for a particular mount and or path using offline access for files.

== Connecting

The first time you run your ownCloud Android app, it opens to a configuration screen.
Enter your server URL, login name, password, and click the btn:[Connect] button.
Click the btn:[eyeball] to the right of your password to expose your password.

For best security, your ownCloud server should be {enable-ssl-url}[SSL-enabled] so that you can connect via HTTPS. The {app-name} will test your connection as soon as you provide it and tell you if you entered it correctly. If your server has {create-self-signed-ssl-cert}[a self-signed SSL certificate], you'll get a warning that it is not to be trusted. If this happens, click the btn:[YES] button to accept the certificate and complete your account setup.

With that completed, you're now ready to use the {app-name}.
At this point, you'll be on the _"All Files"_ screen, which you see below.

By clicking the main menu at the top left, you will be able to manage the core functionality of the app. The options are:

* xref:accounts.adoc[Manage Users Accounts]
* xref:files.adoc#current-uploads[Current Uploads]
* xref:files.adoc#all-files-view[All Files View]
* xref:settings.adoc[Application Settings]

[NOTE]
====
To use Two-Factor Authentication, ownCloud server must have the {oauth2-app-url}[the OAuth2 app] installed, configured, and enabled. Please contact your ownCloud administrator for more details.
