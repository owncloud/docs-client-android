== Introduction

This section describes how to install and upgrade the {app-name}.

== Installation

One way to get your ownCloud Android app is to log into your ownCloud server from your Android device using a Web browser such as Chrome, Firefox, or Dolphin.

The first time you log into a new ownCloud account, you'll see a screen with a download link to the {app-name} in the {play-store-url}[Google Play Store].

You will also find these links on your Personal page in the ownCloud Web interface. Find source code and more information from the {owncloud-mobile-download-url}[ownCloud download page]. Users of customized ownCloud Android apps, for example from their employer, should follow their employer's instructions.

== Upgrading

When you download your {app-name} from the Google Play store, it will be upgraded just like any other Play Store application, according to your settings on your Android device.

It will either update automatically or give you a notification that an upgrade is available.
If you are using an ownCloud Android app from a custom repository, e.g., your employer, then it will update in accordance with their policies.

== New Features Wizard

The first time that you use the Android app, you will see the _"New Features Wizard"_. The wizard, similar to wizards in other applications and operating systems, gives you a quick overview of the new features in the {app-name}, so that youâ€™re familiar with them as quickly as possible.

The new features covered in the wizard are:
