= Manage Users Accounts
:toc: right

:app-name: ownCloud Android App

== Introduction

Initially the path to the accounts section isn't visible. To get to it, first click the btn:[down arrow], in the user details section, which will replace the _"All Files"_ and _"Uploads"_ buttons with _"Add account"_ and _"Manage accounts"_.

Then, click btn:[Manage accounts]. From there, you can see all of the currently active user accounts, along with a button to add a new account.

== Adding Accounts

To add a new account is identical to creating the first account. Click btn:[Add account], and then follow the instructions in xref:connecting-to-your-owncloud-server[Connecting to Your ownCloud Server].

== Viewing Accounts

After clicking btn:[Manage accounts], you will see a list of the currently active accounts in the application, as in the screenshot below. Each entry in the list has shortcuts to:

* View the user's files
* Change the user's password
* Remove the account

== Removing Accounts & Logging Out

To remove an account, click the btn:[rubbish bin] icon, next to the key icon. This will display a confirmation dialog, asking if you want to remove the account. If you click btn:[Yes], the account will be removed.

This action also logs you out of the server and deletes the database with the list of files. However, any files downloaded onto the device prior to removal will still be there afterwards. You can find them in the public partition.

NOTE: There is no logout function that both logs out of your account *and* leaves all your files on your Android device.

== Change User Passwords

To change a user's password, click the btn:[key] icon, next to the user's details. This will display the user details page, with the ownCloud server URI and user account, pre-filled. Enter a new password, and click btn:[Connect], and the password will be updated.
